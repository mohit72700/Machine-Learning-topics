# Feature scaling- Normalization
<p>Normalization is a scaling technique in Machine Learning applied during data preparation to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale. It is not necessary for all datasets in a model. It is required only when features of machine learning models have different ranges.</p>

## Here are some benefits of normalization in machine learning:
* <p> Improved Model Performance</p>
* <p> Faster Convergence</p>
* <p> Prevention of Numerical Instabilities</p>
* <p> Preventing Overfitting </p>
## Requirement
<p> Jupyter Notebook</p>

## Note
You can download the python code file and csv file of dataset and understand the code and run the code on the jupyter notebook and enjoy the result.
