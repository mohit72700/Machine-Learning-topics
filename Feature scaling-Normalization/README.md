# Feature scaling- Normalization
Normalization is a scaling technique in Machine Learning applied during data preparation to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale. It is not necessary for all datasets in a model. It is required only when features of machine learning models have different ranges.

## Here are some benefits of normalization in machine learning:
* <p> Improved Model Performance</p>
* <p> Faster Convergence</p>
* <p> Prevention of Numerical Instabilities</p>
* <p> Preventing Overfitting </p>
