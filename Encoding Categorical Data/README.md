# Encoding categorical data:
For nominal data there is a technique called OneHot encoding and for ordinal data there is a technique called ordinal encoding.
## 1.OneHot Encoding
OneHot encoding is a technique that we use to represent categorical variables as numerical values in machine learning model.

## 2.Ordinal Encoding
We can use Ordinal Encoding provided in Scikit learn class to encode Ordinal features. It ensures that ordinal nature of the variables is sustained.
