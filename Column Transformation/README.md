# Column Transformation:
In many real-world datasets, you might have a mix of numerical data, categorical data, and text data. Each type of data requires different preprocessing steps before feeding it into a machine learning model. The column transformer helps you streamline this process by defining a sequence of transformations, each applied to specific columns.
