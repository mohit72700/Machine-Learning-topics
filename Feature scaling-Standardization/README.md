# Feature Scaling:
Feature scaling comes under feature engineering in machine learning. Basicaly there are two types of feature scaling
* <p>Standardization</p>
* <p>Normalization</p>
In this file you will see how standardization works and depends on mean and standard deviation.
   I hope you will enjoy after running the code file in your system.
